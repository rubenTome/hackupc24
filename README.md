# Travelers United :airplane:
Shared Journeys, Unforgettable Memories!

## Inspiration

This application is based on travelperk challenge on the hackupc event, celebrated in Barcelona in 2024. We use a dataset provided by travelperk, as well as multiple technologies, APIs and library available on the internet. For the frontend, we use the React framework, due tue its ease of use and our familiarity with this technology.

Our application facilitates communication between individuals travelling internationally, enabling them to connect, make new friends and discover new travel experiences or alternatives. Additionally, it allows users to organise trips, including transport and event reservations in the destination city.


## What we learned?

With this project we have acquired new skills by stepping out of our comfort zone. With backgrounds spread across different disciplines, we tried to collaborate to build something in which we could acquire knowledge in those fields that we have neglected the most.
The use of a key-value database was something new for us, used to using relational databases. We made use of Google's Firebase, although we would have liked to use an open source tool. For the backend we decided to use Flask, while for the frontend we used React, connecting both with a Rest API. A small data analysis is done using Pandas.

## How it was build?

For the construction of the application from the beginning, more sources of information were sought to complete the application than was available. Thus two distinct ‘branches’ can be identified. The first one focuses on extracting and managing the attached data. And a second one that focused on looking for different external APIs to offer more services within the application.
For the backend Python :snake: combining it with Flask was some Pandas. For the database as we talk before Firebase was used and for frontend React.js. To test the petitions to the API Rest we used Postman and 

## Future Work

The next steps in this project should be to improve the user experience and to look for more resources that can improve the quality of the product. Another step would be to look for a more abundant source of data that could lead to more complete and interesting analyses of the data, as these were somewhat scarce. The time constraint resulted in a rapid development where we prioritised our efforts in building an idea which limited the development of the product.
